# Automatic white matter segmentation

We propose an automatic method to classify the brain fibers generated by the tractography of a subject.

* The project was carried out on data provided by the O'Donnell Research Group from the Human Connectome Project (HCP)[1].
The objective is to classify the fibers into 57 white matter areas called tracts. 
* To classify a 3D shape we use here a method based on multi-view representation. We used the fly-by-cnn project[2] to build a sequence of images representing each fiber at different locations in space.
* Then, we used an RNN to predict the class of each fiber from this sequence as well as its confidence in the prediction made.
